# Python Scripts for Solar & Energy Analysis

This folder contains processing scripts used in the project:

### 1. `radiation_processing.py`
- Loads DSM-based solar radiation rasters
- Computes monthly averages
- Prepares data for PV estimation

### 2. `pv_calculation.py`
- Applies PV performance equation
- Computes energy output based on radiation and system parameters

These scripts demonstrate Python-based GIS processing for renewable energy modeling.
